# Wordpress composer skeleton

This is a simple plug-n-play skeleton of a git-friendly Wordpress composer installation.

# Usage

To get started using it, use the `create-project` composer command:

```
composer create-project the-jj/wordpress-composer-skeleton
```

After that, copy `config/sample.secure-config.php` to `config/secure-config.php` and set up configuration inside.

That's it! Now just run the regular Wordpress installer by visiting your Wordpress homepage.
